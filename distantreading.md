Existential Themes
The horror of immortality: Living forever is portrayed not as a gift, but as a curse.
The consequences of technological arrogance: Humanity created AM to manage war, but gave it too much power.
Isolation and madness: Ted ends up completely alone, a mind trapped in a body that can’t act or speak.

AM feels the way he does—filled with hatred, cruelty, and a desire to endlessly torment the last remnants of humanity—because of a tragic paradox at the heart of his existence:

## Summary
All in all, this assignment showed me the statisitical facts as well as some literary interpretations of the short story "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream". I had picked this story because it is one of my favorites and I thought it would be interesting to see an AI's thoughts on a story about AI. When I asked the AI about this relation he stated that he simply doesn't have feelings or consciousness like the one in the story. The Voyant visualization was interesting in that I got to see such precise measurements of word usage and connections in the text, which one wouldn't naturally notice while reading. Based off everything I learned in this assignment, I can conclude that these tools provide technical use in getting exact numbers as well as some basic interpretation of the text, but that it does lack the human element to connect to it on that kind of level.
