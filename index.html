<h2>About Me</h2>  
    <p>My name is Carlos Estevez and I am a Visual Arts Management major with a minor in Marketing. My experience is largely in design programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator and video editing. However,I started learning and practicing with html code and website design at the beginning of 2025 for a college course. I also started dabbling in Inky code around March. The world of programming is still relatively new to me but I look forward to expanding my knowledge in it and merging it with my skills in visual design.
