# Abstract

The goal of this Twine narrative is to be an exploration of mankind’s creation of the arts and the inherent need for it. Art, when analyzed in all its forms, has been an integral part of our species’ culture since the beginning as shown by the cave paintings of even the earliest humans (Skumanich). This can be viewed as both a way of communication as well as recordings to be passed on throughout history. However, despite these practical purposes for art’s creation, there is a deeper and more personal fulfillment that it provides. Through the practice of creativity, you can come to a better understanding of yourself and those around you. There have been reports of psychiatrists using the arts, whether it be dance, music, or painting, to better understand the human mind, which is imperative for their field of study (DeAngelis). It is also something that is deeply ingrained into our culture which makes up our societal structure. Art can be used to showcase and express the intricacies of different cultural communities as well as bridge the gap between them through similarities and understanding (Fernandez). In the modern era, there has been an over emphasis on analysing the technical aspects of art when the true importance of it is the emotions it makes us feel when we view it or work on it (Kemp). At the end of the day, the arts are in their essence subjective and while there is merit to the critique of it, the greatest value is the benefits it does to the mind, soul, and our connections. Art therapy has even become a solution to those who suffer from serious mental health problems (Phillips). It is a key and a window into our hearts.
